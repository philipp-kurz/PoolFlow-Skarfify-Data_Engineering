# PoolFlow&Skarkify - Data pipeline of an imaginary company
This repo contains my self-contrived **capstone project** for Udacity's **Data Engineering Nano-Degree** (DEND).

During this online course I learned about various data engineering topics such as relational and NoSQL data modeling, data warehousing, data lakes and data pipelines and gained hands-on experience with their application through different projects. I got especially interested in **Apache Spark** and what it brings to the table in terms of big data processing, and decided to utilize my capstone project to further deepen my learning about Spark.

**PoolFlow and Skarfify are leading airport retail chains.** PoolFlow sells swimwear while Skarfify sells scarves, mittens and hats. As the companies grew and opened more stores, the executives of both companies realized that their businesses were heavily dependent on the season and the origin of travelers. To diversify their product portfolios and adapt better to the changing seasons, **PoolFlow and Skarfify decided to merge together**. From now on, all stores will be operated jointly under the original name PoolFlow&Skarfify and products from both companies will be sold at the shared store locations.

With this, **a few crucial questions remain** to be answered, such as: 
- What products should be sold at which locations? 
- How should the product portfolio change with the seasons? 
- Which products are likely to be bought at which airport?

PoolFlow&Skarfify's team of data scientists noticed early on that the type of products purchased (swimwear vs. cold-weather accessories) correlates heavily with the location of the airport and the climate in that region. Additionally, the amount of travellers entering the country at those airports, where they are from, and for what reason they are travelling also seems to have a strong impact on purchasing behavior.
